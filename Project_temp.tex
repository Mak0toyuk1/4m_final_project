\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Abstract}

The study of diabetes is vital in understanding the progression of the disease and identifying key predictors. Throughout this paper, we perform data analysis on the diabetes dataset, primarily focusing on leveraging various statistical methods that we learned in STATS 4M03$\backslash$6M03: Multivariate Analysis. By using a variety of methods, our goal is to predict the onset of diabetes from detailed medical diagnostic measurements based on several contributing health factors --- with the aim of uncovering patterns and relationships between various clinical and lifestyle factors. Through this analysis, we hope to emphasize actionable insights for clinical decision-making and provide preventive strategies. 

\subsection{The Data}

In this paper, we will study the \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasibur013/diabetes-dataset}{Diabetes Dataset}. \cite{Kaggles}. The diabetes dataset contains 768 rows x 9 columns, representing various health diagnostic metrics for predicting diabetes. Each row corresponds to a unique patient record, with features capturing key medical attributes. Table~\ref{tab:DibetesTab} showcases each of the columns in the dataset and a description of each of the columns. We will be using R \cite{Rlang} as our main computing software

\subsubsection{Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)}

\begin{enumerate} 
	
	\item Figure~\ref{fig:outcomeplot} illustrates that there are a lot more individuals without diabetes than with diabetes. Figure~\ref{fig:ageplot} showcases that the ages listed in this dataset follow a right-skewed distribution, where majority of the individuals are aged 20-30. 
	
	\item Figure~\ref{fig:corplot} illustrates the relatively high correlation between "SkinThickness," "BMI," and "Insulin." We also note that "Glucose" is reasonably correlated with "Insulin," "BMI," and "Age." Furthermore, "Age" is highly correlated with "Pregnancies." 
	
	\item The true label of this dataset is "Outcome," whereas the other variables are considered the predictors. Since our dataset is not that large, we determined that we should use all of the predictors as they all show reasonably high correlation with each other. 75\% of the data will be used for training, whereas the rest will be used for testing. 
	
	\item We cannot apply factor analysis on our dataset as it is not normally distributed. This can be confirmed by the shapiro test and normal QQ plot. For dimensionality reduction, we would use principal component analysis. We will use 3 principal components.\\

\subsubsection{Data Preparation} 

We write about the training and testing here, and how we used column 9 as a label. We also scaled the dataset.\\

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Supervised learning Analysis} 
 In this section, we perform supervised learning analysis using Classification trees: k-Nearest Neighbours and the following ensembles method: Random Forests Classifiers.\cite{zhou2012ensemble}
 
 \subsubsection{k-Nearest Neighbours}

 Firstly, we executed the k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm \cite{peterson2009k} on our dataset. The algorithm is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier that uses proximity to make classifications about the grouping of a dataset.

 \subsubsection{Random Forest Classifiers}
 
 Also, we used the Random Forest Classifiers \cite{zhou2012ensemble} on our dataset. Random Forest classifiers is a bootstrapping sampling method that combines the results of multiple decision trees to draw on a conclusion. The algorithm \cite{Lecture16} is an extension of the bagging algorithm \cite{Lecture16} that creates uncorrelated decision trees, for each tree, a random sample of $\mathcal{M}$ is taken at each decision tree split.

\subsection{Binary Logistic Regression}
We performed a binary logistic regression analysis \cite{faraway2016extending}, a supervised learning method, to explore the relationship between various predictor variables and the binary response variable “Outcome,” indicating the presence or absence of diabetes. The initial model incorporated eight predictor variables: Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, and Age. These variables were selected based on their potential relevance to diabetes risk, informed by existing domain knowledge.\\
\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
The objective of the analysis was to identify the most significant predictors using the backward elimination method, a stepwise regression technique. This approach began with a model including all predictors, subsequently removing variables in sequence based on the highest p-value exceeding 0.05. This systematic elimination of statistically insignificant predictors not only enhances the model’s interpretability but also minimizes the risk of overfitting, ensuring that the final model retains only variables with significant contributions to predicting the outcome.

\subsection{Boosting}

Boosting \cite{chen2015xgboost} \cite{friedman2001greedy} is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple weak learners, typically decision trees, to create a strong predictive model. For this analysis, we used XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting), which is efficient and optimized for large datasets, to predict the presence of diabetes based on clinical measurements.

The model was trained on 70\% of the data, leaving 30\% for testing. The binary outcome variable (1 = diabetes, 0 = no diabetes) was predicted using features such as glucose levels, BMI, and age. Missing or zero values were present in some predictors (e.g., insulin), which could influence the model's performance.

\textbf{Model Parameters}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Learning rate (\texttt{eta}): 0.1
	\item Maximum tree depth (\texttt{max\_depth}): 6
	\item Evaluation metric: Area Under the Curve (AUC)
	\item Number of boosting rounds (\texttt{nrounds}): 100
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}

		\end{tabular}
	}
	\caption{Binary Logistic Regression Output}
	\label{tab:BinLogReg}
\end{table}

From (Table~\ref{tab:BinLogReg}), we see that "BloodPressure," “SkinThickness,” "Insulin" had the high p-values, indicating they are not significantly associated with the outcome. At this stage, the MCR is 0.3697917. \\\\

	\end{tabular}%
	}
	\caption{Binary Logistic Regression Output Post-Adjustment}
	\label{tab:BinLogRegA}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:BinLogRegA} demonstrates that all remaining variables exhibited p-values below 0.05, confirming their statistical significance. Additionally, the misclassification rate decrease to 0.21354, signaling enhanced model performance. Consequently, the variables ‘Pregnancies,’ ‘Glucose,’ ‘Blood Pressure,’ ‘BMI,’ ‘Diabetes Pedigree Function,’ and ‘Age’ were identified as having a significant influence on the “Outcome.” This suggests a strong association between these factors and the risk of diabetes in females.

\subsection{Boosting}

The model achieved an accuracy of 78.3\% on the test set, with an AUC of 0.85. The AUC, derived from the ROC curve (Figure~\ref{fig:roc}), demonstrates the model's strong ability to distinguish between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.

The feature importance plot (Figure~\ref{fig:importance}) reveals that glucose is the most significant predictor, followed by age, BMI, and genetic predisposition (DiabetesPedigreeFunction). These results align with established medical understanding of diabetes risk factors.

\end{figure}


Boosting effectively identified significant predictors of diabetes, particularly glucose and BMI. However, the model's performance may be affected by missing data and the dataset's limited size. Future work could address these limitations by imputing missing values and validating the model on larger datasets. Overall, XGBoost proved to be a robust method for this binary classification problem.

\subsection{k-Nearest Neighbours}

% might want to include plot
After executing the tune.knn() function in $5$-fold cross validation. We found that the best value for $k$ is $5$. Then, after inputting $k=3$ into the knn() function, we found that the MCR of the k-nearest neighbours is $0.2916667$.

\subsection{Random Forest Classifiers}

%we wanna include the Variable importance plot here
After executing the tune.RandomForest() function in $5$-fold cross validation. We found that the best value for mtry is $4$ and the best value of ntree is $200$. Then, after inputting mtry $=4$ and ntree $=200$ into the RandomForest() function, we found that the MCR of the random forests is $0.28125$. \\
Finally, we also observe that Glucose and BMI are the two most important variables according to the variable importance plot.
